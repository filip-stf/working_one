### Early life

Samwise lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, better known as "The Gaffer", on Bagshot Row in The Shire, close to Bag End. Sam's mother was Bell Goodchild; he had five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold. He was a friend of the Cotton family and used to play in Bywater Pool with Jolly, Tom, Nibs, and Rosie Cotton specifically.
A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple Hobbit of plain speech. He helped his Gaffer tending the garden of Bag End and was taught the art of rope making by his grandfather and his uncle Andy. In his work at Bag-End, he was acquainted with Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo taught him letters, and nurtured his love for Elves, poetry, and his belief that the world contains greater wonders than most hobbits are aware of. This set him apart from the beginning to the Gaffer's dismay. Sam often wandered outside Hobbiton and knew well the area twenty miles around.
On 12 April Sam was in The Green Dragon and discussed with Ted Sandyman the strange rumours he heard around the Shire, including his cousin Hal seeing a Tree-man, and the Elves who leave Middle-earth. Ted called his cousin crazy and dismissed all rumours. In the evening, he returned to Hobbiton Hill thinking about the hard work he has to do when he saw Gandalf arriving to visit Frodo, after many years.

### Eavesdropping on Frodo and Gandalf

Sam was one of the " Conspirators " who were summoned by Merry Brandybuck in order to watch over Frodo Baggins and the Ring inherited by Frodo from Bilbo. Being the closest to Frodo, Sam was their "chief investigator" who was to eavesdrop on his talks with Gandalf the Wizard.
He eavesdrops on Frodo and Gandalf's discussion while working at the garden of Bag End. It was when Gandalf revealed to Frodo that Bilbo's ring is Sauron 's One Ring, and on the mention that Frodo must leave the Shire, Sam choked. Initially suspected as a spy, Sam feigned innocent curiosity. Sam begged Gandalf not to turn him into anything "unnatural". Sam then immediately asked to be taken to see Elves when they went away. Gandalf decided to make Sam Frodo's first companion.

### From Hobbiton to Crickhollow

Sam joined Frodo on his journey to Bree and Rivendell, as to outside appearances as Frodo's gardener. He lied that he had the lightest baggage after Frodo complained about the weight of his, and he offered to take more. Sam and Pippin Took followed Frodo to his new house at Crickhollow and when they were encountered by Black Riders Sam mentioned that one of those was asking his father about Frodo. Later they met one of the Wandering Companies of Elves; the experience of meeting Elves the first time left him speechless (although they were different than he expected, "so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were," as Sam described them ); the hobbits camped with them and Sam was like in a living dream, mentioning it as one of the most important events of his life. He was enchanted especially by their singing. The Elves warned him not to leave Frodo on his journey, and Sam denied he would ever think about it.
The next day Sam insisted that Pippin should leave some elven bread for their breakfast. That morning, Sam felt changed, feeling that he had to fulfill a role that lies beyond the Shire, something more important than meeting Elves or dragons or seeing mountains.
At Crickhollow where his and the Conspirators' role was revealed. Merry joined the travellers on their way to Bree.

### Crickhollow to Rivendell

The hobbits decided to risk travelling through the Old Forest to avoid Black Riders. There Old Man Willow put a spell of sleepiness on the four hobbits. Once Merry and Pippin slept by the tree and Frodo bathed his feet in the Withywindle, the willow tree tried to drown Frodo and swallowed Merry and Pippin, but Sam proved the most resistant. He saved Frodo from drowning and tried to start a fire to frighten Old Man Willow but the tree threatened to squeeze the hobbits in two if he did not put it out. They were saved by Tom Bombadil and stayed in his house for two days. Sam was the only hobbit who slept contentedly.
They passed through Barrow-downs and came to the Prancing Pony at Bree where they were joined by " Strider ". Sam did not trust the ranger at first, but Frodo accepted his help as they could not get to Rivendell otherwise. Sauron 's spies had opened the stables of the inn and all the mounts went loose, therefore before leaving the village, the company purchased a pony from Bill Ferny. Sam loved and tended the animal, and named him Bill, after his owner. Upon their departure, Bill Ferney saw and taunted them. In response, Sam threw an apple at his head.
As they came to Weathertop, Sam recited a poem about Gil-Galad that Bilbo had taught him. After Frodo was stabbed by a Ringwraith, his distrust toward Strider only grew, and he was distraught when he learned that Frodo's wound might subdue him to the Black Riders' will. When the group came to the old place where Tom, Bert, and William had been turned to stone, he sang " The Stone Troll ", an original composition of his, for the others.

### Fellowship of the Ring

When they reached Rivendell, Sam was beside Frodo's bed while he was recovering from the Morgul-wound he was inflicted on Weathertop and hardly left except to run messages. Once Frodo awoke, Sam led him to join the rest of the party. He had begged to wait on Frodo but was told that for this time he was a guest of honor. When Frodo reunited with Bilbo, Sam sat near near them and listened as they spoke together until he fell asleep.
The following day, Sam eavesdropped on the Council of Elrond and remained silent until it was revealed that Frodo would be the Ringbearer. Then Sam was unable to contain himself any longer and revealed himself, asking if Frodo was meant to go alone, to which Elrond responded that he at least should accompany Frodo as it is impossible to separate them, even when Frodo is invited to a secret council and Sam is not.
Sam insisted on bringing Bill along on the journey, saying he would pine if he did not come. At that point, he lamented that he had not brought rope but found that it was too late to find some now. Sam was dismayed when he learned they were to enter Moria, and he was even more dismayed that they had to send Bill away when they entered Moria when wolves were about. Sam saved Frodo's life as the Watcher in the Water tried to seize him with one of its tentacles. As they passed by fissures and chasms there, Sam once again remarked that he wished he had brought rope. Sam received a scratch along his scalp for his first orc kill in the mines. When Frodo was pinned against the wall by an Orc-spear, Sam hacked and broke the spear-shaft.
In Lothlórien, the Elves remarked that Sam breathed so loudly that they could shoot him in the dark. Sam was the only one of the four hobbits who had no trouble sleeping upon the Elves' flet, and he remarked that he will go on sleeping whether or not he rolled off in his slumber. In Cerin Amroth, once the Fellowship was unblindfolded, Sam was surprised by the bright daylight in an Elven realm, and he remarked that he "thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than anything I ever heard tell of".
Sam made a verse in honour of Gandalf's fireworks. He, along with Frodo, looked into the Mirror of Galadriel where he saw trees being felled and that the Old Mill had been replaced by a large red-brick building. Sam considered going back to help those at home, but, being warned by Galadriel not to let the mirror decide his choices, Sam decided to finish his task with Frodo. At their parting from Lórien, Galadriel gave Sam a box containing earth from her orchard.

### Journey to Mordor

At the Falls of Rauros Frodo tried to leave the Fellowship secretly by boat, but Sam pursued him and leapt into the water although he could not swim. Thus after the Breaking of the Fellowship, Sam was the only member of the Fellowship to remain with Frodo. When Gollum joined up with them, Sam remained distrustful of his loyalty to Frodo, and treated him with disdain, and partially (though unintentionally) pushed Gollum to betray Frodo in Shelob's Lair. As Sam, Frodo, and Gollum travelled, Sam began to worry about their food supplies running short and he, unlike Frodo, still thought of the return journey. In Ithilien, he decided to risk a fire and stew rabbit, but he accidentally let it smoke which attracted the attention of Faramir and his rangers who were also in that region. There, to Sam's delight, he got the chance to see an oliphaunt. Faramir took the hobbits to Henneth Annûn where Sam accidentally revealed the purpose of their quest, but Faramir did not hinder it and Sam judged his quality to be "the very highest.", saying he reminded him of Gandalf.
Gollum led the hobbits to the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, where Sam, in a conversation with Frodo, reflected on whether their adventure would be put in tales and songs to be told by a fireside and noted that they were part of a greater tale than themselves.
Gollum betrayed the hobbits in Shelob's lair, hoping to find the Ring among Frodo's bones once Shelob had eaten him. However, Sam pierced Shelob's flesh, being the first person ever to have done so, but not before Shelob seemingly killed Frodo.
Grieving for Frodo, Sam took the Ring. At first, he was tempted to go on a quest for revenge on Gollum but instead chose to complete the quest. However, upon learning that Frodo still lived, he rescued him from the Tower of Cirith Ungol and returned the Ring to him. Because he held the Ring for a time, he is considered one of the Ring-bearers.
Together, Sam and Frodo crossed Mordor to Mount Doom. Sam himself carried Frodo up the slope for part of the way. There, Gollum tried to attack the hobbits and Sam spared his life now he had an idea of what it had been like for Gollum to be Ring-bearer—a choice which soon led to success in their quest. After the destruction of the Ring, both Sam and Frodo were honoured by King Elessar for their deeds.

### Later life

After the War of the Ring, and the Scouring of the Shire, Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful and beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of Galadriel's soil at the root of each. He was especially shocked that the Party Tree was cut down and planted a silver nut in the Party Field where it had once been, and the nut grew into the Golden Tree, the only Mallorn tree in the Shire.
He married Rose "Rosie" Cotton on 1 May S.R. 1420. In honor for restoring the Shire his family was given the name Gardner.
They had thirteen children: Elanor the Fair, Frodo, Rose, Merry, Pippin, Goldilocks, Hamfast, Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby, Robin, and Tolman. When Frodo sailed on the White Ship, at the end of the Third Age, Sam inherited Bag End and was entrusted the Red Book of Westmarch.
After Will Whitfoot resigned his post as Mayor of Michel Delving (the largest town in the Shire and the "unofficial capital"), in Fo.A. 6, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire, that would be the first of seven consecutive 7-year terms. Soon after his election he established a rule of succession and inheritance in situations such as the headless Baggins family, since Bilbo and Frodo went over the sea and was impossible to presume death. During his service, King Elessar appointed the Mayor as a Counsellor of the North-kingdom. In S.R. 1436 he met King Elessar on the Brandywine Bridge and was awarded the Star of the Dúnedain. In S.R. 1442 he left Tolman Cotton Junior as deputy Mayor so that he rode to Gondor with his wife and his daughter Elanor, maid of honour to Queen Arwen, to spend a year there. When Elanor married Fastred of Greenholm, he requested from Thain Peregrin to make him Warden of Westmarch in S.R. 1462.
After his wife died in Fo.A. 61, on 22 September Sam left Bag End, and went to the Tower Hills where he was last seen by Elanor, entrusting to her the Red Book; according to her, he went to the Grey Havens to sail across the Sea and be reunited with Frodo in the Undying Lands.

## Characteristics

Sam has brown eyes. At some points his hands are described as brown. This could indicate he belongs to the Harfoots, as they are described as having browner skin than the Fallohides, to which breed Merry, Pippin and Frodo belong. Or it could simply be a tan from years of working outside. His face is often described as red-faced, turning scarlet or blushing. At one point his face is said to have turned white, before flushing scarlet. Sam was a representative hobbit. He was vulgar and cocksure, but his devotion to Frodo moderated his conceit. For him, his service and loyalty was the measure of his heroicism and bravery.
