### Fellowship of the Ring

For the early part of the quest, the nine companions walked single file, Gandalf leading, Legolas, with his keen eyes, providing the rearguard. When the Company came to Hollin, Legolas was very deeply moved: the wholesome air yet spoke of the Elves that dwelt there long ago, and his sharp ears heard the very stones crying out for grief at their departure and memory of their ways.
As they ascended Caradhras, Legolas in his light shoes could walk on top of the snow, whereas the others were forced to trudge and wade their way forward. But snow or no snow, nothing could dampen his buoyant Elven spirit, and he joked lightly with Gandalf even at the darkest moments. He scouted ahead and behind the company, dancing over the snow with great ease, and brought news that the storm was, as they had been fearing, put out to stop them by some Power greater than they. When this report arrived, Gandalf reluctantly decided to abandon the idea of crossing by the Redhorn Gate. Legolas stayed near the Hobbits on the dangerous descent.
At the bottom of the mountain, the company took a vote on attempting passage through Moria. Legolas was silent until asked for his opinion, and then said simply and seemingly reluctantly, "I do not wish to go to Moria." His loyalty and respectful deference to the decisions of the two leaders, Aragorn and Gandalf, extended even to following them through darkness and unknown horror; of all the Company, he was arguably the most loyal to leadership. When the voices of the Wargs were heard and the attack began, Legolas did perhaps more than anyone save Gandalf, shooting numerous Wargs and even collecting his spent arrows to fire again, retrieving them, like a responsible bowman, after the fight ended.
The Fellowship reached the West Gate of Moria, and were halted by the doors fast shut. At last gaining entrance, the Company, following Gandalf's staff, began their march through Moria, a pit so profoundly dark that even Legolas' eyes could see nothing. He served his turn, like the others, in lookout duty through the night on the march. When they came to the Chamber of Mazarbul and were attacked by the Orcs, Legolas dispatched at least two before following the others out the east door, having to drag Gimli away from Balin 's tomb. When Durin's Bane made its frightful appearance, Legolas was the first to spot it when he turned to shoot an arrow towards the Orcs. He recognized it immediately as a Balrog, and it is the only recorded time he was ever truly afraid: a Balrog held far more terror for an Elf than for any other, for only they remembered where the Demons of Fire had come from and whom they had first served.
After the fall of Gandalf, Aragorn led the Fellowship eastwards to the borders of the forest of Lórien. Legolas was seized with a deep excitement, for none of his kindred had been into the wood for many years, and he himself had only heard of it from tales. He was grieved, though, that it was winter, and the full glory of the Mellyrn was departed. The Fellowship splashed across the Nimrodel river, feeling their weariness drained away by its cool waters. As they rested on the shore, Legolas told the tales of Lothlórien still remembered by the Mirkwood Elves and sang to them part of the Lay of Nimrodel. At last, the Company turned aside from the path in order to shelter in the trees for the night, not caring to be caught on the ground by the Orcs pursuing them from Moria. Upon being surprised and questioned by the Elves of Lórien who were watching from a tree, Legolas responded cautiously in their own tongue. When Samwise queried as to what they were saying, Legolas slyly responded, "They say that you breathe so loud they could shoot you in the dark." He hastened to add that they need not fear the Elves.
Legolas was called up to meet with the Galadhrim, bringing Frodo, though Sam followed, as always. The Galadhrim had heard Legolas' singing and knew him for one of their northern kindred. They had had tidings from the sons of Elrond as to the Quest upon which the Company was embarked, and readily accepted all of the fellowship save Gimli, who was only grudgingly allowed, for the suspicion of the Elves of Lórien towards the Dwarves was especially acute. Legolas was forced to answer for the company, with the reminder to keep an eye on "that dwarf". The next morning, when the Elves took the company across the river Celebrant on their way to Caras Galadhon, they told Gimli he would have to be blindfolded, but he was outraged and refused. When Aragorn offered for all of the Company to wear blindfolds, Gimli said if only Legolas would wear one, he would. Legolas was outraged in turn, but Aragorn settled the dispute by asking to blindfold the whole of the Company. In the end, Legolas had no choice but to agree.
In Lothlórien, many Elves sang of Gandalf, and their language was such that only Legolas could understand. Legolas would not translate the lamentations for the rest of the Company, saying that he had neither the skill nor the heart. During their time in Lórien, however, with the influence of the Lady Galadriel permeating the air, he became fast friends with Gimli, a friendship that would never be broken. He was one of the Company that could handle boats, and when the Fellowship prepared to leave Lórien, he was assigned to paddle one with Gimli. From the lady Galadriel, he received an Elven cloak and brooch, like the others, and a long, stout bow and quiver of arrows, such as the Galadhrim used.
When the Company was ambushed by orc-archers on the Anduin, Legolas quickly leaped out onto dry ground and up the riverbank with his bow, searching in the darkness for any sign of the Orcs. From Frodo's low position in the boats, he appeared to be crowned with white stars as he stood tall upon the bank. Suddenly, the south wind chased the clouds away, and a chilling dread fell on the Company. Legolas looked up, and sighed, " Elbereth Gilthoniel!" as if to draw strength to face the terror riding high in the wind. As the Shadow approached, he bent the great bow of Lórien and shot the descending Fell beast from the sky, one of his most masterful deeds. He was praised by the rest of the Company for this, especially Gimli.

### Three Hunters

When the company was ambushed on Amon Hen, Legolas shot many Orcs until his arrows ran out, and then used his knife. Upon the breaking of the Fellowship, when he learned that Boromir had fallen, he sang a lament with Aragorn, taking the part of the South Wind, which came from the Sea. Legolas was of great aid to Aragorn in the days following, as he helped to track the Uruk-hai across Rohan. His eyes could see many leagues, and for a while he could see their quarry far ahead of them.
When accosted by the Riders of Rohan led by Éomer, Legolas stood by his friend Gimli when confronted by the haughty Marchwarden, threatening him with death if he attempted to harm the dwarf. When Éomer lent them horses to speed them on their way, Legolas was given Arod, a very high-spirited horse. But Legolas had the Elvish way with beasts, and after he had leaped lightly upon Arod, the horse was docile beneath him. Legolas let Gimli ride behind him on the way to Fangorn Forest in their search for Merry and Pippin. When they arrived by the smoking pile of Orc ashes, they combed the battlefield for any sign of the Hobbits for several hours, but gave up as night approached. Camping under the eaves of the forest, Legolas noticed how the tree beneath which they sat seemed glad of the fire they lit, stretching out its limbs and leaves to the heat. Though the night was very dark, he was also the first to notice the absence of the horses. Later he asserted to Aragorn that the beasts sounded joyful, confirming Aragorn’s own guess.
Upon entering Fangorn, Legolas declared that he almost felt young again beside those trees. He commented that in earlier days he could have been happy there. Gimli snorted, saying, “ I dare say you could. You are a Wood-elf, anyway, though Elves of any kind are strange folk. ” Legolas would later reverse this declaration at the Hornburg. When the Three Hunters met with the apparition of an old man, whom they believed to be Saruman, despite Gimli’s encouragement Legolas did not shoot him. The old man declared, " Put away that bow, Master Elf. " Legolas dropped his bow, but later picked it up again, and was about to shoot when it was seen that beneath the old man’s robes there was white. Yet he recognised that it was Gandalf just in time, and shot his arrow high in the air to be consumed by fire. Gandalf coolly added, " Well met, I say to you again, Legolas! "

### With the Rohirrim

Legolas was the first to ask Gandalf about Merry and Pippin, and Gandalf’s apparently miraculous escape. After the story, Gandalf delivered Galadriel's messages to each of them, Legolas' being:
Legolas Greenleaf long under tree In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea! If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.
Later, Legolas again used his eyes for the help of the company, as he spied both of Isengard and Edoras from afar. He played only a passive role in the healing of Théoden King, and later was arrayed in shining mail beside Aragorn. Gimli would not ride on Éomer's horse unless Legolas rode beside them, which he did gladly. Éomer declared, " Legolas upon my left, and Aragorn upon my right, and none will dare to stand before us! "
As Legolas stood at the Hornburg at the eve of battle, he said that he did not like the place. Gimli comforted him, and he was glad that the dwarf stood by his side. He also wished that a hundred archers of Mirkwood were there, noting the small number of bowmen among the Rohirrim. At the opening of the battle, Legolas shot twenty at least, this figure being taken as precise by Gimli. When Gimli returned to the elf for the second time to declare that he slew twenty-one, Legolas counted his kills as twenty-four. By the time the Fire of Orthanc blew out a piece of the wall, his quiver was nearly empty. With the last arrow the elf saved Aragorn’s life when he stumbled while pursued. At the end of the battle, Legolas had shot a total of forty-one, though Gimli surpassed his count by one.
Legolas showed great interest in the Huorns on the way to Isengard, discussing them with Gandalf and a less willing Gimli. Legolas promised Gimli that he would go to Aglarond after the war upon hearing the dwarf’s eloquence, if only Gimli would accompany him on a return to Fangorn. At Isengard he enjoyed a meal in the company of Gimli, Aragorn, and the Hobbits, Merry and Pippin.

### Return of the King

When Aragorn made clear his purpose as to the taking of the Paths of the Dead, Legolas and Gimli willingly volunteered to go with him. Legolas predicted, when Gimli suggested that Galadriel might have sent them soldiers from their own lands, that they need not ride away to find war.
Amidst the Paths of the Dead, riding with the Grey Company, Legolas alone, save for Elladan and Elrohir, Elrond's sons, felt no fear of the Oathbreakers, and it may be remembered that the High Elves had power both in the worlds of the seen and unseen. Yet his turn came to be struck to the heart in the opposite sense – when he heard the gulls at Pelargir, fulfilling Galadriel’s prediction and warning. While telling this story later, he stopped there, while Gimli promptly said, " For my part I heeded them not ". Legolas saw as Aragorn led the Dead Men what a mighty lord he might have been if he had taken the One Ring.
Legolas came with Aragorn from the ships during the Battle of Pelennor Fields, and fought there beside his comrades. He survived the battle, and afterward commented on the longevity and eventual domination of Men to the dubious Gimli.

### Battle of the Morannon and aftermath

Legolas rode for the last time into battle beside his friends to the Battle of the Morannon. He witnessed the Fall of the Dark Tower, and after the battle attended the ceremonies of the Field of Cormallen in honour of Frodo and Samwise and their victory. That night Legolas would not go to bed, but instead went away to walk in the woods, singing of the Sea.
At the urging of Aragorn, Legolas remained in Minas Tirith for a time, after attending the coronation of Elessar. During the parting of the Fellowship, Legolas went with Gimli to Aglarond. After that, he rode off with Gimli to return to Fangorn Forest.

### After the War of the Ring

In the early Fourth Age Legolas brought south Elves out of Greenwood, and they dwelt in Ithilien, which became once again the fairest country in all the westlands. During his stay in Ithilien, Legolas devised the renowned gardens of Prince Faramir's new home in the Hills of Emyn Arnen.
Legolas and the Wood-Elves later worked together with Gimli and the Dwarves to rebuild and improve Minas Tirith. After King Elessar died in Fo.A. 120, Legolas built a grey ship in Ithilien and sailed down the Anduin and onwards into the West, reportedly taking Gimli with him.

### Appearance and equipment

Christopher Tolkien recounts that his father wrote the following "wrathful" comment protesting against a "pretty" or "ladylike" depiction of Legolas:
He was tall as a young tree, lithe, immensely strong, able swiftly to draw a great war-bow and shoot down a Nazgûl, endowed with the tremendous vitality of Elvish bodies, so hard and resistant to hurt that he went only in light shoes over rock or through snow, the most tireless of all the Fellowship. J.R.R. Tolkien, The Book of Lost Tales Part Two, p. 327
At Rivendell, Legolas was dressed in green and brown garb, and he was probably dressed similarly for the duration of the quest.
He bore a bow from Mirkwood, and later a Bow of the Galadhrim. He also had a long white knife. He was a master archer, unmatched by any other during his time, capable of shooting adversaries from afar, and on occasion kill more than one with a single arrow, as shown when he nailed two orcs through the throat in Moria. His skill with a bow was even more formidable due to his keen eyesight. At the Battle of the Hornburg, he also proved skilled at knife-fighting in close quarters.

### Personality

Legolas showed almost irrepressible cheerfulness throughout the journey, passing through Caradhras and even the Paths of the Dead without hesitation or complaint. His youthful nature can be seen from the mocking way he spoke of the "strong men" on Caradhras, who Boromir (meaning himself and Aragorn) had said could forge a way out through the snow. He is perhaps most remembered for his friendship with Gimli the Dwarf, and it was during this friendship that we see his faithfulness, and also his love of beauty. Gimli's words moved him when the dwarf spoke of the Glittering Caves.

## Etymology

The name Legolas is a Silvan dialect form of pure Sindarin Laegolas, which means "Greenleaf". At one point he is called "Legolas Greenleaf " by Gandalf, coupling his name and its translation like an epithet. Legolas consists of the Sindarin words laeg, a very rare, archaic word for "green" (cf. Laegrim, Laegel(d)rim, the Green Elves ), which is normally replaced by calen (cf. Calenhad, Parth Galen and Pinnath Gelin ); and golas, a collection of leaves, foliage (being a prefixed collective form of las(s), "leaf"). In one note, Tolkien considered Legolas to be a non-Sindarin name, instead being Ossiriandish in which laiquā > lēgo (shortened in trisyllabic names to lěgo ). The Quenya cognate of Laegolas was Laicolasse.
